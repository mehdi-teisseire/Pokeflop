# Write anything you want to not forget here

Make an event in only one condition that gets the button text (= move you want to attack with) and returns it depending on where you press
(maybe put coordinates of each button in a list and iterate with mouse position on click?)

for multiple loops: just return the function to "game.state"; smaller loops may avoid memory leak?

import strictly what it is used; maybe it can reduce lags?

put trainer obj in turn instead and rename turn to player turn or something

healing doesn't work
append move in json makes multiple moves (see json)
