# Write anything you want to not forget here

put trainer obj in turn instead and rename turn to player turn or something

healing doesn't work
append move in json makes multiple moves (see json)
text not centered (text surface size, hitbox surface something something)
some ui elements are initialized with args and initialized again with method (need to fix repeats)
